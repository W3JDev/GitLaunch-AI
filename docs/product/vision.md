# Product Vision: GitLaunch AI

## The Problem
Developers build amazing tools, libraries, and SaaS products, but they often struggle to sell them. 
- **Time constraint**: Writing copy and designing UI takes time away from coding.
- **Skill gap**: Backend engineers often lack design or marketing expertise.
- **Generic solutions**: Templates like Wix or Squarespace feel too "corporate" or "e-commerce" for developer tools.

## The Solution
**GitLaunch AI** is the "DevRel in a Box". It acts as a specialized designer that reads code and speaks "Developer".

By analyzing the source of truth (the repository), GitLaunch creates a landing page that is:
1. **Accurate**: Pulls features directly from the code context.
2. **Relevant**: Chooses aesthetics (Dark mode, monospaced fonts, code snippets) that appeal to technical users.
3. **Instant**: Zero-config generation.

## Value Proposition
For Open Source Maintainers: **"Get more stars and contributors by looking professional."**
For Indie Hackers: **"Launch your MVP's marketing site in 30 seconds."**

## Long-term Strategy
1. **Phase 1 (Current)**: Client-side generation with manual export.
2. **Phase 2**: Vercel/Netlify integration for 1-click hosting.
3. **Phase 3**: Continuous Sync (Update the landing page when `README.md` changes).
