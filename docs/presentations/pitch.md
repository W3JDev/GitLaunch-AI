# GitLaunch AI: The Pitch

## The Hook
Developers are architects of the future, but they are often terrible marketers. We see incredible open-source libraries die in obscurity simply because their `README.md` didn't inspire confidence.

## The Problem
Building a landing page requires a completely different skill set than building a backend API. Design, copywriting, asset generation, and mobile responsiveness are friction points that stop developers from launching.

## The Solution
**GitLaunch AI** is the "1-Click Launch" button for codebases. We don't just provide a template; we provide an **Agency**.
- Our AI acts as the **Senior Copywriter**, extracting benefits from code.
- Our System acts as the **Senior Designer**, applying semantic layouts based on the project type.

## The Market
- 100M+ GitHub Repositories.
- Millions of Indie Hackers and Solo-preneurs.
- Every library needs a documentation site. Every SaaS needs a landing page.

## The Ask
We are building the standard for automated web design. Join us in making the web more beautiful, one repo at a time.
